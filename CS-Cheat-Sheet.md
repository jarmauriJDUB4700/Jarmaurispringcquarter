Carl - What is Computational Thinking. What are its parts? What does it help programmers do?
- The process of breaking complex problems into simpler terms.
The parts of computational thinking
- Pattern Recongition
- Abstraction
- Decomposition
- Algorithms

E.J. - What is Pattern Recognition. Give and example.
Pattern recognition is recognition patterns. Some patterns are visual while some are cognitive. Patern recognition is about seeing the repetitions.

Semaj - What is Abstraction? Give an example.
Abstraction is hiding all the parts of the code that you don't really need to see. Or you can think of it as simpplifying the code. You can think of a car for example. It has many parts like the engine, and electronic systems throughout the car. But you only need to see the steering wheel, brakes, etc.

Taqari - What is Decomposition? Give an example.
 Decomposition is the process of breaking a large, complex problem into smaller, simpler parts so that each part can be solved more easily.

Nishad - What is an Algorithm? Write a sample algorithm for any process.
An algorithm is when you use certain amount of steps to solve a problem or compllete a task.
Start

Take a kettle

Fill the kettle with water

Switch on the kettle

Wait until the water boils

Place a tea bag in a cup

Pour hot water into the cup

Add sugar or milk if required

Stir the tea

Serve the tea

Stop

Marshawn - What are the 4 common Data Types?
- Integers (Whole numbers)
- Floating-point numbers (floats): Numbers with decimals
- Strings: words
- Booleans: True or  false
What's the best data type for storing a username? variable-character strings

Kenlon - What does an If-Statement do? What does the else statement do? Create a sample if-else statement.
An If-Statement is a command that is only excecuted if somehting specific happens. if weather == 'Sunny':
                                                                                    print ('Wear a T-Shirt')
                                                                                   else:
                                                                                    print ('Wear a Jacket')



Nahum - What is a Variable? What defines a 'good' and 'bad' name for a variable? Give an example.

A variable is a container for data, that can be used later. A good variable is one that has a name thats clear and makes sense for the data inside, whereas a bad variable would have a nonclear name that doesn't make sense for the data inside. An example of a good variable would be 'points = 4' as the name is clear and make sense for its inside data, a bbad one would be 'stats = brandon', its a bad variable due to it's name not matching the inside data.

Xavier - What is a Function? When is it useful to use them?

A pre-made set of code that you can re-use.

Maximus - What is a Loop? Define both a For-Loop and a While-Loop.
A loop is a control structure that reapeats block of instructions until specfic condittion is met

A for loop is a control flow statement in coding that allows a specfic block of code to be excuted repeadlty, A while loop is a control flow statment that repeadlty excutes a block of code as long as specified boolean ondition remains true

Jeffrey - What is a Bug? What does it mean to Debug your code? Give an example of a type of bug/error that can occur in code. A bug is a probelm in a code that can be big or small, its called a bug because a mans device was not woring and it turned out to have a literal bug in it. A common bug could be putting the same thing twice but not the same same. For example if you put class:english  you have to put it EXACTLY like that, you can't put class:English.

Isaiah - What is a Class? What is an Object?

Tay - What is a Library?

Braylen - What is a List? What are the rules surrounding a list?

Jarmuari - What are the Arithmetic Operators? What do each do? Write a sample line of code that uses one of these operators

"+" operator means  if 2+3=5 it allow you to add with in coding

"-" operator means if coding 3-2=1 it allow you to subtract with in coding

"x" operator means if coding 5x5=25 it allow you to Multiply with in coding

My definiton: giving the Operator there symbols with in the code and eqautions.



Ja'Den - What is Version Control? What version control system have we been using? Why is version control useful? Version control is a system that records changes to files over time so that specific versions can be recalled later. A Version Control system we uses it github. Version Control is useful because it keeps a history of changes.

Joseph - What is Syntax? Given an example of proper Python syntax for creating a variable. Now do it using wrong Python syntax.

Darren - What is a Programming Language? Why do multiple programming languages exist? Give 5 examples of programming Languages.

Darren- 5 different programing languages are Java, JavaScript, python, switft, python, C++. A programing language is a  way for humans to write instructions that a computer can understand and  to perform tasks, such as solving problems, running apps. Having many languages lets programmers choose the one that best fits the job. For example two different languages are python and java script. Python focuses more on data and automation while JavaScript focuses on interactive websites.

Walter - What is a Comment? Are comments mandatory in code? Why do programmers use them? Write a comment for this line of python code explaining what the code is doing --> myName = "Devon"





Avery - What is Indentation? Is indentation mandatory in every programming language? What benefits does indentation provide
    Indentation is pressing the tab key to push a line of code/characters to the right.
Indentation is not mandatory in every programming language, but it is in many languages. Other than being required for some languages, like python, to function, it can make code more readable. It looks like this:
not indented
    indentedd
        even more indented





Kristopher - What is an IDE? Which IDE have we been using to write our code so far? What are other examples of IDEs?
A IDE is a software application that helps test, edit, write and debug code
We have been using visual studio code
some examples of IDE is AWS Cloud9, Xcode, PYCharm ETC



Kamari - What is a Terminal? What is a Shell? What do they do?
A text based interface used to communicate directly with the users computer
A terminal is a program that lets you type commands directly to your computer instead of clicking with a mouse. A shell is the part inside the terminal that reads your commands and tells the computer what to do. Together, they let you run programs, manage files, and control your computer using text commands.

Joaquin - What is Object Oriented Programming? What are the 4 pillars of OOP? What is a programming language that uses OOP?

Object Oriended Programming (OOP) is just a way of writing code using objects that combine data and actions. The four pillars of OOP are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

encapsulation: Keep data safe inside an object
abstraction: Hide complex details, show only what’s needed
inheritance: Reuse code from another class
polymorphism: Same action name, different behavior

Kauri - What are the Comparison Operators? What do each of them mean? What is the Assignment Operator? What does it do?
Comparison Operators are used to compare two values
